# Table Visualization Application #

With this application you can create graphs and pies from a table that contains numbers. You can edit the table and add the numbers you want.
Then there are three options. First: You can draw a graph for each column, Second: You can draw a pie for each column, Third: You can save the table you created (json files) and reload it again whenever you want with php and ajax requests. 

(You have to download the project locally and run it with a virtual server that has php activated, or in a real php server, in order to run it in full scale cause of real time requests and the save feature.)

Check the application (except save feature) live [here](https://kkatsi.github.io/TableVisualizeApp/).
